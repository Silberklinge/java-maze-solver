# java-maze-solver
A Java program that reads an image file of a maze and traces the solution to the maze using the A* pathfinding algorithm.

To run the program, download the "main" folder and convert its contents to a runnable JAR file. Then, run the JAR with a suitable maze image (such as the sample maze provided) in the same directory as the JAR. A dialog will pop up once the JAR has finished running, which indicates whether a solution was found or not. If so, the JAR creates a new image file of the solved maze in the same directory as the JAR. If not, the dialog simply pops up, informing the user of the lack of a solution, and nothing more happens.
